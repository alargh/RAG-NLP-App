**The 72 Most Anticipated Tours of 2025**

Lady Gaga, Beyoncé, Oasis, Kendrick Lamar & SZA, Japanese Breakfast, and more of the most essential tickets of the year.

Why do we discover new music if not to feel a little spark of recognition, to decide it might be love, to search out the artist’s tour dates and spend a little too much money on tickets; to save the date, maybe entreat a friend to join; and finally to put on a massive winter coat and, when we finally arrive at a familiar local venue, wonder what to do with it as we watch that music brought to life? Below, selected by us here at Pitchfork, are some artists and shows where you might find such joy and fellowship in 2025. Prepare for audacious showmanship, borderline offensive stage banter, and very possibly a few punch-ups—or, if you didn’t get Oasis tickets, just having a really nice time at some concerts.

Billie Eilish’s Hit Me Hard and Soft: The Tour has been running for two months—and that’s just the beginning.

Read about the British group’s new era in “Black Country, New Road Head Into the Unknown.”  
–Jazz Monroe  

---

**The Black Keys**  
The Black Keys had to cancel their arena tour last year, so Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney are looking for a course correction. Their newly announced No Rain No Flowers Tour will hopefully get the job done, as it takes the duo across the United States and Europe for a run of theater and festival shows supported by Hermanos Gutiérrez and the Heavy Heavy.  
–Walden Green

**Bright Eyes**

–Madison Bloom  

---

**Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band**  
The Boss is back on the road, and rumors of his retirement were greatly exaggerated. “We’ve been around for 50 fucking years!” he told a Philadelphia crowd last year. “We ain’t doing no farewell tour bullshit!” He’ll be proving it all night in Europe this spring and summer, with dates in England, France, Germany, Czechia, Spain, and Italy.  
–Jazz Monroe  

---

**Charli XCX**  
Brat Summer may be over, but the *Brat* era continues.

Several dates will include a duo performance with fellow guitar experimentalist Bill Nace.  
–Eric Torres  

---

**Dead & Company**  
Dead and Company can’t stop saying goodbye. This spring, they will bring a new show to Las Vegas Sphere with a two-month residency, which, we are once again led to believe, may be the last chance to catch this Grateful Dead postscript before the book finally closes.  
–Jazz Monroe  

---

**Deafheaven**  
Deafheaven will return, in late March, with *Lonely People With Power*, the genre-blending black metal band’s first studio album in four years.

–Madison Bloom  

---

**FKA twigs**  
FKA twigs would have been halfway through her North American *Eusexua* tour by now, but sadly she had to postpone the initial run of dates following a visa issue. “Today, I was informed that production did not fill out the correct paperwork in a timely manner for us to have our visas to come to the U.S.A. and perform,” she said in a video posted on March 25. Fortunately, she was able to reschedule her New York and Chicago dates; she’ll perform in New York on April 23 and 24, and Chicago on June 24 and 25. twigs is also readying her performance at Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival later this month.  
–Madison Bloom  

---

**Fontaines D.C.**  
The new era of Fontaines D.C. proceeds apace. The band returned, newly homed at XL Recordings, with the star-marking *Romance* last year—a stadium-sized record tailored to some of the biggest shows of the Irish group’s career.

–Jazz Monroe

–Madison Bloom  

---

**Gang of Four**  
Nearly half a century after their formation, Gang of Four are staging a valedictory tour this year. Appropriately called The Long Goodbye, the influential English post-punk band’s last North American tour will kick off in Massachusetts, in mid-April, and run through the end of May. “It’s been wonderful, but all things must end,” they said. “We want to go out with a bang and celebrate with our fans and friends.” Keeping to their word, the remaining members will play two sets each night: a full performance of their landmark 1979 debut album *Entertainment!*, plus deep cuts and fan favorites from across their catalog.  
–Walden Green

–Madison Bloom  

---

**Jack White**  
Jack White’s No Name Tour will chug on into 2025 with a hefty North American schedule appended to his modest batch of dates behind *No Name* in small clubs and ad hoc venues last year. He’ll play multiple nights in most cities on the itinerary, sticking to venues small enough to keep things feeling personable.  
–Jazz Monroe  

---

**Jane Remover**  
Jane Remover has a busy 2025 planned, reviving the Venturing moniker for a mystery new album and plotting a new Jane Remover record, apparently called *Revengeseekerz*, leaning into the blown-out rap of their digicore days. As we await news of those records’ release, you can catch them on the the Turn Up or Die Tour, a jaunt across North America with Dazegxd, D0llywood1, and Lucy Bedroque.  
–Jazz Monroe  

---

**Jamie xx**  
“This is gunna be funnn!” Jamie xx said upon announcing his intercontinental tour behind *In Waves*. The producer has already taken his act to cities in Asia and North and South America, and there are plenty more dates to come in the United States and mainland Europe.  
–Madison Bloom  

---

**Japanese Breakfast**  
Nearly four (busy) years since her Japanese Breakfast album *Jubilee*, Michelle Zauner finally has a studio follow-up on the way.

–Jazz Monroe

After a busy live schedule throughout most of last year to celebrate the release of *Here in the Pitch*, her standout fourth album, Jessica Pratt appears to be taking it easy when it comes to her 2025 tour plans. The entrancing singer-songwriter returns to the stage on March 26 at Treefort Music Fest and then journeys across the United States for a few more dates. From there, she will fly to Europe for Roskilde Festival and Bilbao BBK Live, both in July.  
–Nina Corcoran  

---

**Julien Baker & Torres**  
Indie-rock artists Julien Baker and Torres are joining forces for *Send a Prayer My Way*, an upcoming collaborative country album that they’ve been considering since 2016.

–Eric Torres  

---

**Kendrick Lamar and SZA**  
Many years after the former Top Dawg Entertainment labelmates Kendrick Lamar and SZA first went on tour together, they’re joining forces once more for another leg. Cue the Grand National Tour, their upcoming run of live shows in stadiums across North America. The tour begins in Minneapolis on April 19 and lasts on through to June 18, when it will end in Washington, D.C.

–Nina Corcoran

**King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard**

–Jazz Monroe  

---

**Kraftwerk**  
For some reason, Tony Hawk leads a choreographed skateboarding sequence in a half-pipe in the promotional video for Kraftwerk’s new tour. The huge North American run extends the 50th anniversary of their landmark album *Autobahn*, celebrations of which dropped in last year with a Los Angeles residency. The multimedia shows combine music, visuals, and performance art, but, as far as we know, no kickflips.  
–Jazz Monroe  

---

**Kylie Minogue**  
Kylie Minogue is hitting the road behind her brand new album *Tension II*—the sequel to 2023’s *Tension*. The pop icon will get warmed up in February with several dates in her home country of Australia, before jetting off to cities in Thailand, Japan, and Taiwan. She’ll follow that with a tour of North America in the spring, performing in Toronto, New York, Boston, Atlanta, Phoenix, Seattle, Denver, Los Angeles, and more.  
–Madison Bloom  

---

**Lady Gaga**  
This fall, Lady Gaga brings the Mayhem Ball to North America and Europe. For those seeking chaotic Gaga magic without the bustle of impersonal big venues, don’t fret. Gaga has touted the itinerary—which includes New York’s Madison Square Garden, Chicago’s United Center, and the London O2—as being admirably low-key. “I wanted to create a different kind of experience—something more intimate—closer, more connected—that lends itself to the live theatrical art I love to create,” she said. Leave your binoculars at home, then, and prepare to get up close and personal with Gaga as she eschews the world’s biggest stadiums in favor of—well, the world’s biggest arenas.  
–Jazz Monroe  

---

**LCD Soundsystem**  
LCD Soundsystem are readying a truncated tour of the South that includes five dates in Texas (three concerts in Austin and two in Dallas), as well as stops in New Orleans and Atlanta.

–Eric Torres  

---

**Magdalena Bay**  
Magdalena Bay dropped their debut album, the glittering *Mercurial World*, back in 2021.

–Eric Torres  

---

**Max Richter**

–Jazz Monroe  

---

**MIKE**  
New York producer and rapper MIKE has planned a long run of dates for his upcoming #AOTC Tour. MIKE—whose upcoming album *Showbiz!* arrives this month—will start off in Dublin in February before hitting several more European cities. The rapper will then tour North America starting in Philadelphia in April, with further stops in Miami, Houston, Los Angeles, and elsewhere.  
–Eric Torres  

---

**MJ Lenderman**  
For an artist who seemingly lives on the road, the maverick singer-songwriter (and Wednesday bandmate) MJ Lenderman has a knack for observing the sort of characters you usually only meet after spending *way* too long in the same place. His companionable album *Manning Fireworks* is full of them, and he will bring along the full cast of benign slackers and small-time jerks for a sprawling tour that takes in much of North America and a few cities in the UK. Stick around long enough and you might find yourself on the next record.  
–Jazz Monroe  

---

**Mogwai**  
Mogwai return with a new album, *The Bad Fire*, this month, a few years after scoring their first UK No. 1 with *As the Love Continues*.

–Jazz Monroe  

---

**Mount Eerie**  
Phil Elverum is bringing his Mount Eerie project on the road in support of *Night Palace*, his first solo album as Mount Eerie in six years.

The tour is set to end on April 20, in Washington, D.C. Opening that first leg of the tour are Ragana, while Hana Stretton and Precious Bane join Elverum for the latter half. Alan Sparhawk will perform at two concerts sandwiched in between.  
–Nina Corcoran  

---

**Mustafa**  
To celebrate finally releasing his long-awaited first LP, *Dunya*, Mustafa will bring his storied folk songs to fans around the world this year. Dubbed his debut world tour, the singer-songwriter and poet will perform live in cities in North America, Europe, and Africa across two separate legs. The Lost in the Dunya tour begins on February 11 in San Francisco, California, and comes to an end on May 25 in Port Sudan, Sudan. The Canadian-Sudanese singer’s tales of facing death, violence, and grief with love, resilience, and friendship are a balm in recorded form and even more powerful live.  
–Nina Corcoran  

---

**My Bloody Valentine**  
Who knows how long we’ll be waiting for My Bloody Valentine’s long-promised follow-ups to *m b v*, but fans of the amorphous shoegaze band finally have something firm to clutch on to: four live dates in the UK and Ireland. After a prelude announcement last year of a sole Dublin concert set for November, Kevin Shields and the band have booked a three-date stint in London, Manchester, and Glasgow later the same month.  
–Jazz Monroe  

---

**My Chemical Romance**  
Nearly 20 years after its release, *The Black Parade* is getting the anniversary treatment live onstage this summer courtesy of My Chemical Romance.

A unique slate of openers for each of the 10 dates includes Devo, Pixies, Violent Femmes, Death Cab for Cutie, Idles, and 100 Gecs, among others.  
–Nina Corcoran

–Jazz Monroe  

---

**Nine Inch Nails**  
In the five years since their last albums, *Ghosts VI: Locusts* and *Ghosts V: Together*, Nine Inch Nails have taken a back seat as Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross extended their impressive film-score résumés. Now, as they prepare to follow their Golden Globe–winning *Challengers* score with a soundtrack to *Tron: Ares*, they’ve reconvened with the band for a monster run of dates in North America and Europe.  
–Jazz Monroe  

---

**Nubya Garcia**  
London jazz artist Nubya Garcia released her sophomore album, *Odyssey*, last September. She’s been on tour since, and after a string of shows in Asia and Australia, the saxophonist will take her shapeshifting, orchestral songs on the road in Europe and North America.  
–Eric Torres  

---

**Oasis**  
“Not long now kids are we all excited,” Liam Gallagher posted on X at the end of 2024, proving you’re not the only one counting down the days until the very-real Oasis reunion. The perpetually feuding brothers set aside their beef to plot dozens of massive tour dates around the world this summer and extending on into the fall. Beginning with two shows in Cardiff, Wales, on July 4 and 5, Oasis will play stadiums and arenas across the United Kingdom, Ireland, North America, Australia, and South America—their first shows together as a full band since 2009.  
–Nina Corcoran  

---

**Panda Bear**  
February will usher in *Sinister Grift*, the first new Panda Bear album since 2019’s *Buoys*. The Animal Collective member plans to bring that new material on the road when he joins Toro y Moi for a North American tour at the top of the year. After launching the leg in Minneapolis on February 6, they make their way across major cities in the United States and Canada before ending their tour on May 16. Panda Bear won’t stop there, though. He’s got solo dates in Spain and Portugal in March, as well as more North American and European dates that extend into the summer.  
–Nina Corcoran  

---

**Pearl Jam**  
Eddie Vedder and the crew are sticking it out on the road a year after releasing *Dark Matter* last year. Stay tuned for one-off treats at the arena shows, such as last year’s surprise rendition of “Rockin’ in the Free World” with Steve Van Zandt, Watt, and Glen Hansard, or their cover of Bruce Springsteen’s “No Surrender” shortly afterwards.  
–Jazz Monroe  

---

**Perfume Genius**  
On *Glory*, Mike Hadreas’ upcoming seventh studio album as Perfume Genius and the follow-up to 2022’s *Ugly Season*, the singer and songwriter has brewed up what he calls his “most directly confessional” set of songs yet. He’ll bring the Blake Mills–produced LP to stages during a North American trek in May and June, with stops in Atlanta, Brooklyn, Seattle, Chicago, and more. Urika’s Bedroom will support on select dates.  
–Eric Torres  

---

**Post Malone**  
Post Malone’s country era is now in full swing, and he announced his 2025 tour in typically cowboy-ish fashion. Long before the lineup typically launches, he leaked news of an apparent Coachella headline set by listing dates in Indio, California, the weekends of the festival. That was soon confirmed—the festival released its lineup a day later—but if you can’t make it to the desert, you can find Posty, Jelly Roll, and Sierra Ferrell at stadiums around North America right through to the summer.  
–Jazz Monroe  

---

**Refused**  
Now that Refused have seen a swell of new fans following the resurgence of “New Noise,” their lasting hit-turned-Pavlovian stressor in *The Bear*, the Swedish post-hardcore greats are going out on top with a farewell tour of North America this spring. Starting March 21, in Brooklyn, and ending April 10, in Sacramento, these dates take place nearly a year after frontperson Dennis Lyxzén recovered from a heart attack back. Joining them for the farewell tour are New York ’90s greats Quicksand.  
–Nina Corcoran  

---

**Rilo Kiley**  
In early 2025, Rilo Kiley delighted fans by announcing their first concert in 17 years—a reunion show at Pasadena’s Just Like Heaven festival. The good news kept coming, with a North American reunion tour slated to begin in May. But the demand was clearly bigger; the quartet of Jenny Lewis, Blake Sennett, Pierre de Reeder, and Jason Boesel are now planning to play over a dozen new dates in September, with shows in Boston, Nashville, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and more. “It couldn’t have happened any sooner,” Lewis said of the band’s reunion. “It feels like now is the time to share that joy and love with each other and with everyone else.”  
–Madison Bloom  

---

**Scissor Sisters**  
Jake Shears has spent his time since Scissor Sisters’ heyday performing on Broadway and releasing solo records. Now, he has reconvened the old band (minus co-frontperson Ana Matronic), and will bring along support act Allison Goldfrapp for a tour of the United Kingdom—long home to most of the U.S. band’s biggest fans. “It’s the 20th anniversary of our debut album, so it really feels like the right time to revisit all the intense excitement of that moment,” Shears said in a press release.  
–Jazz Monroe

The return of Sharon Van Etten in 2025 is tied to a new project and gothic new-wave direction.

Their North American tour begins on February 1, in Westerly, Rhode Island, and lasts until May 21, where they end their run in Los Angeles. Opening various concerts along the way are She Keeps Bees, Nabihah Iqbal, and Love Spells.

–Walden Green  

---

**Soccer Mommy**  
It’s only natural that Soccer Mommy would bring *Evergreen*, an album exploring loneliness and nature, snaking through the mountains and rivers of North America on tour. Her live shows start on January 22 in Atlanta, Georgia, and will bring Sophie Allison and her band across the United States and Canada through March. On April 26, they land in Lisbon for a European leg of the tour that wraps in Warszaw on May 22.

**Tyler, the Creator**  
Unless you caught Tyler, the Creator on a shipping container in one of four cities or during his blowout set at his own Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival, your first opportunity to see him perform *Chromakopia* is fast approaching. The boundlessly creative rapper is bringing his show around North America, Europe, and Oceania nearly all year long. From the opening date in St. Paul, Minnesota on February 4 to the final concert in Perth, Australia, on September 4, Tyler, the Creator will be rounding out the shows with openers Lil Yachty and Paris Texas. Whether or not he’ll be feeling “Noid” from all the attention is up in the air.

**The Weeknd**  
*Hurry Up Tomorrow* is here, but the dead of night stretches on for Abel “The Weeknd” Tesfaye, whose After Hours Til Dawn Tour powers through to daybreak with a new batch of stadium dates this spring and summer. As he prepares to put to bed the trilogy that began with *After Hours*, the Weeknd is bringing Playboi Carti and Mike Dean on a run that stretches from May to September with shows at some of North America’s biggest venues, including New Jersey’s MetLife Stadium and Inglewood’s SoFi Stadium.

**“Weird Al” Yankovic**  
Everyone’s favorite accordion player is getting bigger and weirder in 2025 and you’re invited to watch. “Weird Al” Yankovic is taking over North America on a huge headline tour this summer, promising to merge his crowd-pleaser parodies and superfan deep cuts for a show overflowing with wild set design, costume changes, and plenty of props. Beginning with a headlining residency at the Venetian Theatre, in Las Vegas, the tour extends all the way to September 25, where Yankovic concludes the Bigger & Weirder Tour in Florida. “With twice as many players on stage, everything is going to sound twice as good!” he promises.

Wilco also have a run of performances in South America, the United Kingdom, and Europe lined up for this summer following their North American set.
